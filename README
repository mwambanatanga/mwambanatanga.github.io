Description

This is a train car simulator. New passengers (men and women) get on one by one,
choose a place, and have a sit. After some time a passenger vacates his/her seat
and gets off. The most interesting thing is how they make their choices.

At this point there are two strategies: a "male" and a "female" one (N.B.: this 
is just a name, no relation with the real-life behavior).

Male behavior:
* Sit between two women. If not possible, then
* Sit next to a woman (regardless of the other seat). If not possible, then
* Sit between two empty seats. If not possible, then
* Just sit somewhere.

Female behavior:
* Sit between two empty seats. If not possible, then
* Sit between two women. If not possible, then
* Sit next to a woman (regardless of the other seat). If not possible, then
* Just sit somewhere.

It would be fun to:
* Introduce more types of passengers.
*
